# Design-and-Analysis-of-Spacecraft-Lander-Legs-
In this project, I have utilized CATIA V5 to design lander legs and conduct conducted impact test using Ansys Structural with integrated hydraulic dampers and non-reusable honeycomb absorbers for enhanced impact absorption.                         
It has been determined that the honeycomb sandwich structures and carbon-reinforced composites excel in absorbing high-impact energy thus protecting the spacecraft during touchdown, without compromising with the weight of the lander
